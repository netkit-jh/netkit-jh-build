Crash the virtual machines of a Netkit lab.
Crashing corresponds to hardly unplugging their power cord, which is very fast
but at the same time may cause filesystem inconsistencies inside virtual
machines. Depending on the command line being used, it is possible to crash
only a subset of the virtual machines that make up the lab.

  -d DIRECTORY        crash the lab inside DIRECTORY. By default, the lab in
                        the current directory is crashed
  -F, --keep-fs       avoid deleting virtual machines filesystems. This is
                        useful when virtual machines are to be restarted while
                        preserving filesystem contents. By default, all the
                        filesystems are deleted after crashing the
                        corresponding virtual machine. Notice that, regardless
                        of this option, the model filesystem is never deleted
  -k, --kill          crash virtual machines by simply killing their processes.
                        The default setting is to first try crashing virtual
                        machines by sending them a special message via their
                        mconsole socket. If such an attempt fails, the command
                        reverts to killing processes. If the mconsole method
                        happens to fail too often, this option may result in a
                        speedup of the crash process. Otherwise, it is advised
                        to rely on the default setting, as using the mconsole
                        is generally faster
  -l, --list          show a list of running virtual machines after crashing
                        the lab.
  -q, --quick
      --quiet         disable checking whether virtual machines have actually
                        crashed. This results in a faster crash process, but
                        may cause some processes to hang. If this happens, try
                        crashing again without using this option or use vclean.
                        This option slightly reduces the amount of printed
                        information as well.

Miscellaneous:
$(help_option)
$(version_option)

If one or more MACHINEs are passed on the command line, then only those
machines will be crashed (and their filesystems deleted, if asked to). If any
of the MACHINE names are invalid (i.e., it does not correspond to a virtual
machine of the lab), it will simply be skipped.
