Netkit \- The NETwork emulation toolKIT

.SH DESCRIPTION

Netkit is a self-contained low cost solution for the emulation of computer
networks. Within the Netkit environment each network device is implemented
by a virtual machine, and interconnection links are emulated by using virtual
collision domains (which you can see as virtual hubs).

Each virtual machine can be configured to have an arbitrary number of (virtual)
network interfaces. Virtual machines can also be configured to have no interfaces
at all, in which case they can serve as standalone emulated hosts.
However, this is not the application Netkit has been thought for. Netkit is \fBnot\fR
a host emulator: it is a network emulator.

Virtual machines use a customized filesystem which contains a standard Linux
installation (at the time this man page
is being written, it is a Debian distribution), which includes network
oriented software such as routing daemons (RIP, OSPF, etc.), a bunch of servers
(FTP, HTTP, etc.), firewalling utilities (iptables), diagnostic tools (ping, traceroute,
tcpdump, etc.), and other applications. By configuring the appropriate software,
it is possible to make a virtual machine behave as a specific network device
(e.g., a router). See the README in the Netkit filesystem package or the online
FAQs for instructions about changing the contents of the virtual machine
filesystems.

Virtual machines make use of a variant of the standard Linux kernel which is
compiled to be run as a userspace process. This variant is known as \fIUser Mode
Linux\fR (\fIUML\fR) kernel. You can find more information about UML at the
\fIUser-mode Linux Kernel Page\fR (\fIhttp://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net\fR).
See also the README in the Netkit kernel package for information about building
a customized kernel for the virtual machines.

Netkit provides you with two alternative interfaces to start and configure virtual
machines. A set of 'v'\-prefixed commands (\fIvclean\fR, \fIvconf\fR,
\fIvcrash\fR, \fIvhalt\fR, \fIvlist\fR, \fIvstart\fR), which allow to start and
manage single virtual machines while providing finegrained control on their
configuration, and a set of 'l'\-prefixed commands (\fIlclean\fR, \fIlcrash\fR,
\fIlhalt\fR, \fIlinfo\fR, \fIlstart\fR, \fIltest\fR), which ease setting up
preconfigured network laboratories consisting of several virtual machines.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

In order for Netkit to work properly, the environment variable \fBNETKIT_HOME\fR
must be set to the name of the directory Netkit has been installed into.

.SH FILES

Netkit stores its default configuration settings inside a file named
'netkit.conf'. The existence of this file is required in order to make
Netkit work. See \fBnetkit.conf\fR(5) for information about the location of this
file and a description of its format.

This man page: Massimo Rimondini

\fINetkit-JH\fR is a fork of the Netkit-NG project, which is a fork of the original 
Netkit project. The Netkit-JH fork aimed to update Netkit-NG which stopped 
development in 2014 and sought to use a modern Debian distribution and kernel, as
well as bring new features to the project.
.br
Netkit-JH's development is carried out on the netkit-jh's GitHub: 
https://github.com/netkit-jh/. The project is maintained by Joshua Hawking at the
University of Warwick, along with several other students there.

Thank you to the Department of Computer Science and Automation of the University
of Roma 3, LUG Roma 3 and the Computer Networks Research group at Roma 3 for the 
original Netkit project. Thank you to Julien Cartigny for work on Netkit-NG.

monitored. Please use our Github page to submit issues.
