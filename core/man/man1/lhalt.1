.SH NAME
lhalt \- halt machines of a netkit lab
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlhalt\fR [options] [\fIMACHINE\-NAME\fR...]


\" ########################################

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIlhalt\fR command can be used to gracefully shut down virtual machines of
a Netkit lab. \fIlhalt\fR makes use of \fBvhalt\fR to halt virtual machines (see
\fBvhalt\fR(1)).

By default, \fIvhalt\fR stops all the virtual machines of the lab. If a list of
\fIMACHINE\-NAME\fRs is provided, then only virtual machines with a
matching name \fIand\fR that are part of the lab will be halted.

The following options are supported by \fIlhalt\fR:
.TP
.B
\-d \fIDIRECTORY\fR
Halt the Netkit lab that is located inside \fIDIRECTORY\fR. If no \fB\-d\fR
option is provided, \fIlhalt\fR assumes that the lab is located in the
current directory. The path to the lab directory (being that the current
directory or one provided by \fB\-d\fR) must never contain spaces.

.TP
.B
\-l
.PD 0
.TP
.B
\-\-list
Show a list of currently running virtual machines after the lab has been
halted. This is useful to check whether all the hosts have been shut down.

.TP
.B
\-q
.PD 0
.TP
.B
\-\-quick
This option prevents \fIlhalt\fR from checking whether virtual machines have
properly halted. Hence, it speeds up the halt process. Notice that, unlike
\fBlcrash\fR (see \fBlcrash\fR(1)), a shutdown fails or succeeds regardless of
the use of this option (i.e., no benefit is gained from retrying without this
option).
.br
This option is incompatible with \fB\-r\fR or \fB\-\-remove\-fs\fR.

.TP
.B
\-r
.PD 0
.TP
.B
\-\-remove-fs
Delete virtual machines (COW) filesystems (.disk files) after halting the
corresponding machines.
Default action is to keep the filesystems, so that the lab can be restarted while
preserving filesystem contents.
.br
Using this option never affects the model filesystem. This option is incompatible
with \fB\-q\fR (\fB\-\-quick\fR).

See the README in the Netkit filesystem package for information about COW and
model filesystems.


.PP
The following standard options are also supported.

.TP
.B
\-h
.PD 0
.TP
.B
\-\-help
Show usage information.

.TP
.B
\-\-version
Print information about the installed Netkit release and the host kernel version
and exit. If "\fI<unavailable>\fR" is printed instead of a version number,
then the corresponding information could not be retrieved (for example because
a non-standard Netkit kernel or filesystem is being used).

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

All Netkit commands require that the \fBNETKIT_HOME\fR variable contains the
name of the directory Netkit is installed in.

Apart from this, \fIlhalt\fR supports no other environment variables.
